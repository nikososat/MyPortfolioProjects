# Famous Paintings Analysis
## Project Overview and Business Goals
An aspiring art collector asked me to analyse this dataset to help him navigate into art and find potential buying targets to start building a collection.  

## General Findings
The dataset is about **420 different artists from a total of 18 countries**. However, artists from the **3 most featured countries (France, USA and Holland) add up to more than half of total**.

**24 out of the 56 featured museums are located in the USA**. That certainly explains the bias towards the American artists of the dataset! To depict this bias I calculated the percentage of paintings of each country's artists exhibited in its own museums vs abroad.

There's only a **slight but existing trend for positive difference in the average price of paintings made by early departed artists**. I picked < 30 y.o. as an upper limit to determine 'early' but any value up to < 36 confirms that trend. Also the youngest artist to make it into the list died at 27.

The most featured subject in this dataset's artists' works is 'Portait', the **most valued (greater average price of works) 'Landscape Art'** and the least valued 'Still Life'.  

Size of work matters a lot! **48" x 96" or 96" x 48" paintings are a lot more expensive than smaller ones**.
