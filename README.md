# Nikolaos Satlas Portfolio Projects
## [Tasty Bytes Report](https://github.com/nikososat/MyPortfolioProjects/blob/main/Tasty%20Bytes%20Report/README.md)
The **'Tasty Bytes Report'** is my **Datacamp Data Science Professional Certificate** project, which I had to deliver along with a video presentation of my key findings, insights and suggestions in order to get my certificate (after I'd passed the exams). It's about predicting which recipes will trigger high traffic when presented on the main page of a website, using relevant past data.

I used **pandas** for data cleaning and analysis, **matplotlib** and **seaborn** for visualizations and **scikit-learn** for modeling and predicting.  
## [PizzaSales](https://github.com/nikososat/MyPortfolioProjects/blob/main/PizzaSales/PizzaSales.pdf)
That's a **Microsoft PowerBI** 2-page report that visualizes insights and trends of a whole year Pizza Sales dataset. The first page is an overview of this business while the second presents the 5 top/bottom performing pizzas by Revenue, Items and Category. There are also slicers in both pages to choose category or a specific date range as well as buttons to navigate through the report (though in this pdf version no interaction is possible!).  
## [Uber Data Analysis](https://github.com/nikososat/MyPortfolioProjects/blob/main/Uber%20Data%20Analysis/README.md)
This is a project I started studying to learn how to use **PySpark** for analysis but I soon realised it didn't provide correct answers, so I had to give it a try myself! 10 questions pleaded for answers (I couldn't help adding my own too!), hidden in a small - but a bit tricky - dataset.  
## [Famous Paintings Analysis](https://github.com/nikososat/MyPortfolioProjects/blob/main/Famous%20Paintings%20Analysis/README.md)
This is a **PostgreSQL** project based on a Kaggle dataset. It's about **validating, cleaning and analysing** data about artists, their paintings and the museums where they are exhibited.  
## [Executive Dashboard](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/nikolaos.satlas/viz/BootcampExecutive/ExecutiveDashboard)
This is the Executive Dashboard I designed in **Tableau Public** as an assignment for Zach Wilson's Data Engineering Community Edition Bootcamp to provide a clear, high-level overview of device usage. It highlights:
* the share of each device category relative to total unique devices, and
* the share of events generated by each device category relative to total events.
The dashboard is deliberately minimal and static, optimized for quick stakeholder understanding at a glance.
## [Exploratory Dashboard](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/nikolaos.satlas/viz/BootcampExploratory/ExploratoryDashboard)
This is the Exploratory Dashboard I built in **Tableau Public** as an assignment for Zach Wilson's Data Engineering Community Edition Bootcamp to support deeper analysis and interactive exploration. It includes multiple charts and filters, allowing analysts to:
* track event trends over time,
* compare behavior across device, browser, and OS types,
* explore daily and hourly patterns via an event time heatmap, and
* investigate other key metrics through interactive visualizations.  
The dashboard is intentionally dense, designed to uncover insights through exploration.
