## [Tasty Bytes Report](https://github.com/nikososat/MyPortfolioProjects/blob/main/Tasty%20Bytes%20Report.ipynb)
The **'Tasty Bytes Report'** is my **Datacamp Data Science Professional Certificate** project, which I had to deliver along with a video presentation of my key findings, insights and suggestions in order to get my certificate (after I'd passed the exams). It's about predicting which recipes will trigger high traffic when presented on the main page of a website, using relevant past data.

I used **pandas** for data cleaning and analysis, **matplotlib** and **seaborn** for visualizations and **scikit-learn** for modeling and predicting.
## [Uber Data Analysis](https://github.com/nikososat/MyPortfolioProjects/blob/main/Uber%20Data%20Analysis.ipynb)
This is a project I started studying to learn how to use **PySpark** for analysis but I soon realised it didn't provide correct answers, so I had to give it a try myself! 10 questions pleaded for answers (I couldn't help adding my own too!), hidden in a small - but a bit tricky - dataset.
## [PizzaSales](https://github.com/nikososat/MyPortfolioProjects/blob/main/PizzaSales.ipynb)
That's a **Microsoft PowerBI** 2-page report that visualizes insights and trends of a whole year Pizza Sales dataset. The first page is an overview of this business while the second presents the 5 top/bottom performing pizzas by Revenue, Items and Category. There are also slicers in both pages to choose category or a specific date range as well as buttons to navigate through the report (though in this pdf version no interaction is possible!).
