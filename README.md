My name is Nikolaos Satlas and this is my Portfolio Projects page.  
The 'Tasty Bytes Report' is my Datacamp Data Science Professional Certificate project, which I had to deliver along with a video presentation of my key findings, insights and suggestions as described in the instructions file.
I use pandas for data cleaning and analysis, matplotlib and seaborn for visualizations and scikit-learn for modeling and predicting.  
Uber Data Analysis was a project I started reading to learn to use PySpark but I ended up refining it thoroughly.
