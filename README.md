My name is **Nikolaos Satlas** and this is my **Portfolio Projects** page.  
  
The **'Tasty Bytes Report'** is my **Datacamp Data Science Professional Certificate** project, which I had to deliver along with a video presentation of my key findings, insights and suggestions. It's about predicting which recipes will trigger high traffic when presented on the main page of a website, using relevant past data. I used **pandas** for data cleaning and analysis, **matplotlib** and **seaborn** for visualizations and **scikit-learn** for modeling and predicting.  
**'Uber Data Analysis'** is a project I started studying to learn how to use **PySpark** for analysis but I soon realised it didn't provide correct answers, so I had to give it a try myself! 10 questions pleaded for answers (I couldn't help adding my own too!) hidden in a small - but a bit tricky - dataset.
**'PizzaSales'** is a **Microsoft PowerBI** 2-page report that visualizes insights and trends of a whole year Pizza Sales dataset. The first page is an overview of this business while the second presents the 5 top/bottom performing pizzas by Revenue, Items and Category. There are also slicers in both pages to choose category or a specific date range as well as buttons to navigate through the report.
